Round 1: Rapid Code Swap Teams will tackle five coding problems, but only one member can code at a time. Every 10 to 15 minutes, the coder must switch with their teammate, who continues the work without any direct communication. The team that solves the most problems with optimized code moves forward. Round 2: Code Relay This round features three complex problems with the same relay format, but with a twist—when switching, the new coder cannot see function or variable names from their teammate’s work. Every 15 to 20 minutes, teammates swap roles, relying only on logic to complete the solution. Teams are judged on accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability.
